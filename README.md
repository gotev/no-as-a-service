# No-as-a-Service
In a world of `Things-as-a-Service`, there is a very simple thing which is missing! It's a very basic one, but it's one of the most difficult things in our every day lives. Here it's implemented and provided FREE OF CHARGE!

Sometimes the only possible answer you can give is `NO`. It's not easy, but saying NO is good:

- it's `BETTER` than not responding at all (which may very often be a way to hide a NO, trying to delay the consequences)
  - >I've finished the toilet paper, can you help me? ...

- it's `WAY BETTER` than saying YES and not following through
  - >Can you help me finding my way back home? YES (and going away instantly)
  - >Will I have your support for this thing? YES (and then disappearing in key moments)

- it `INSTANTLY` tells the other party that the question itself contains one or more defects or unmet expectations
  - >(every minute while driving) Are we there yet? NO
  - >Since you're blonde, I think you're a very cute brunette! NO!

- it `MAY` open up a feedback request for improvement
  - >Am I ready for the next step? No! Why? Well, it's because...

- it `MAY` be followed by a clarification sentence, like `NO, but...`, `No, because..`
  - >Doctor I'm sick and I thought this pill can help me! NO, but you can take this one instead!

- it `PREVENTS` wars or very bad things to happen
  - >Should we use a nuclear weapon? NO!
  - >Is it safe to use the toilet without checking for paper first? NO
  - >(after hours of hair styling) Can I touch your hair? NO!

>You already know VERY WELL what are the NO side-effects and consequences, so we can just skip them!

>Btw, this SOFTWARE is PROVIDED AS-IS. WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, and Bla Bla Bla...you won't read till here anyways, so why bothering writing it?
